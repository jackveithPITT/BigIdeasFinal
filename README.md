## Question: What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh?

The hard part of this question is, what defines what is "best"? Best is subjective, and therefore the "best" neighborhood can be determined by a variety of things. Our group has decided that being family-friendly is what we will use to define the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

## Metrics

One metric that we will be looking at to define the "best", most family-friendly, neighborhood is the art installations in Pittsburgh by neighborhood.


Another metric that we will be looking at to define the "best", most family-friendly, neighborhood is the playgrounds in Pittsburgh by neighborhood.


Our last metric that we will be looking at to define the "best", most family-friendly, neighborhood is the courts and rinks in Pittsburgh by neighborhood.
