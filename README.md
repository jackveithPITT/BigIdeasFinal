## Question: What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh?

The hard part of this question is, what defines what is "best"? Our group has decided that being family-friendly is what we will use to define the "best" neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

## Metrics

One metric that we will be looking at to define the "best", most family-friendly, neighborhood is the art installations in Pittsburgh by neighborhood.


Another metric that we will be looking at to define the "best", most family-friendly, neighborhood is the playgrounds in Pittsburgh by neighborhood.


Our last metric that we will be looking at to define the "best", most family-friendly, neighborhood is the courts and rinks in Pittsburgh by neighborhood.
